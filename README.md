## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
- Python 3.9+
- CUDA 11.0+ (optional, for GPU support)
- OpenCV 4.5+

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/watermark-evil.git
cd watermark-evil
```

2. Install Rust dependencies:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up configuration:
```bash
cp config/example.env .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

5. Run the API:
```bash
python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## üîß Configuration

The system can be configured through environment variables or a `.env` file:

- `WATERMARK_EVIL_MODE`: Development/production mode
- `GPU_ENABLED`: Enable/disable GPU acceleration
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to ML models
- `API_KEY`: API authentication key
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity
- `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`: Maximum batch size for processing
- `DB_URL`: Database connection URL

See `config/example.env` for all available options.

## üìö API Documentation

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000` with the following endpoints:

### Detection

```http
POST /detect
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: <image_file>
options: {
  "detect_multiple": true,
  "min_confidence": 0.5
}
```

### Reconstruction

```http
POST /reconstruct
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: <image_file>
detection_id: <detection_id>
options: {
  "method": "hybrid",
  "quality": "high"
}
```

### Complete Pipeline

```http
POST /process
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: <image_file>
options: {
  "detect_multiple": true,
  "method": "hybrid"
}
```

Full API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## üîí Security
